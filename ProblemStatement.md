<div style="text-align: justify"> In July 2016, the Assad regime lay siege to Eastern Aleppo, preventing humanitarian aid from being delivered by air and by land to both the rebels and 250,000 civilians [1]. As the siege stretched on, the available supplies dwindled and the population was at risk of starvation, dehydration and lacked access to medical supplies.</div>


<div style="text-align: justify">There are four critical components to humanitarian aid: food, water, medical supplies and fuel. A pre-packaged human daily ration weighs 850 g [2]. When packaged in bulk, the weight of a daily ration can be reduced to 550 g [2], however that is under the assumption that a partnering party is on the ground to distribute the supplies evenly. Clean water can be achieved with chemical purifiers like chlorine pills, and filters [2]. Most basic medical supplies are not very heavy, such as bandaids, medicine and disinfecting materials. Fuel is required to run field hospitals, and a typical 50-bed field hospital requires 100 kWh/day [2].</div>


<div style="text-align: justify">Given the expected increase in humanitarian disasters in the near future due to climate change [3] and rising political tensions, government and humanitarian aid agencies need a low-cost, disposable method for delivering humanitarian aid supplies to large, isolated populations in active combat zones.</div>
