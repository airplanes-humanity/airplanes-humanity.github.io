Massive humanitarian crises are occurring around the world such as the Siege of Aleppo and the Yemen Civil War, endangering innocent residents with starvation and lack of medical supplies. Active combat zones make it very difficult for aid organizations to safely deliver direly needed supplies. Our solution is single use, low-cost, autonomous gliders made of environmentally friendly materials which can carry supplies to civilians on the ground and be delivered from a safe distance.

Features:
Easy to Use
Destinations can be pre-programmed into the device using an RF Scanner.

Easy to Assemble
For optimal shipping, gliders are packaged flat with all required materials for assembly on-site.

Cost Effective
Designed for single-use, gliders only contain the necessary electronics for a single flight, making them a cost-effective solution.

Distance Rating
Gliders can fly across distances up to 20 km.

Carrying Capacity
Each glider can hold up to 2 kg of supplies.

Environmental Impact
The glider body is made of environmentally friendly materials so as to be easily thrown away after use and decomposing within several months.
