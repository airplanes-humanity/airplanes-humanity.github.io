In order to expedite the software development, we will be testing using an Arduino Prototype. That way, we can interface with sensors before moving to the custom PCB.

## Protoshield

We will be using a protoshield for our prototyping with the Arduino. Protoshields also allow us to:
 - Keep cables organized
 - Ensure components are securely attached while remaining modular
 - Keep the IMU upright and stable

## Sensor Testing

Sensor testing was fairly straightforward. Adafruit provides drivers for all their breakout boards, as well as example code.
