There are four critical components to humanitarian aid: food, water, medical supplies and fuel. A pre-packaged human daily ration weighs 850 g. When packaged in bulk, the weight of a daily ration can be reduced to 550 g, however that is under the assumption that a partnering party is on the ground to distribute the supplies evenly. Clean water can be achieved with chemical purifiers like chlorine pills, and filters. Most basic medical supplies are not very heavy, such as bandaids, medicine and disinfecting materials. Fuel is required to run field hospitals, and a typical 50-bed field hospital requires 100 kWh/day [2].

Speaking with industry experts such as disaster management coordinators and humanitarian logistic experts provided more insight regarding use cases for potential solutions. Christopher Allsop, a disaster management coordinator for Red Cross, described the last mile case where communities outside of larger settlements or where failed infrastructure has cut them off may need assistance delivered to them. He also mentioned a use case for regions affected by health epidemics where geography or political instability restricts access, or in some cases fear of contamination.

Further end user research provided insight regarding the logistics of implementing this kind of solution. The product may require being shipped in large quantities, which means the shipping volume may need optimization. If the product is shipped in parts and requires assembly, it must be easy to build in the field with minimal training. For delivery, it can be assumed the product should fit in boxes and loaded onto shipping pallets. It is essential the product be field serviceable in case of issues, including the exterior body. If a component breaks, it must be easily fixed or replaced.
